<h1>Pen Plotter Planning</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We decided to make a pen plotter for our project, inspired by the letter drawer example, but graphing rectangular equations. It will most likely function via two stepper motors controlling the movement of a pen module on the x and y axes. The pen module would have a pen ane be able to raise and lower it, probably with a servo.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2x Linear Rail/Extruded Aluminum</li>
  <li>2x Stepper Motor</li>
  <li>1x Servo Motor (180Â°)</li>
</ul>
